# Zombie-Apocalypse-Game-Project

Hello There!
What you're seeing here, is my first ever game created since i started learning how to use Unity.

Our team consisted of 2 artists, 1 audio, and 1 coder. And yes, that 1 coder is me.

If you want to try it, you can play it yourself by downloading the "Full-Released-Game" file. After you've done that, click the "Zombie Apocalypse.exe" file on your computer.

Enjoy!
